# 📁 File Sharing System  

## 📌 Introduction  
### Brief Overview  
"I built a file-sharing system using **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Multer**. It allows users to upload and share files, with an option to protect files using a password."  

## 🎯 Project Goals  
### Purpose  
"The goal was to create a simple system for users to upload and share files safely and easily."  

## 🛠 Technical Stack  
### Technologies Used  
- **Node.js**: Runs the server for handling requests.  
- **Express**: Helps manage different routes (like uploading and downloading files).  
- **MongoDB**: Stores information about the files (like file paths and passwords).  
- **Multer**: Manages file uploads.  

### 🔐 Optional Features  
- "Users can set a password to protect their files, making it secure."  

## 🏗 Architecture Overview  
### How It Works  
1. A user uploads a file.  
2. The file is handled by **Multer** and stored.  
3. Information about the file is saved in **MongoDB**.  
4. The file can then be shared with others.  

## ✨ Key Features  
### 📤 File Uploads  
- "Users can upload files, and if they want, they can add a password to protect them."  

### 🔗 File Sharing  
- "Once uploaded, files can be downloaded by others."  

### 🔒 Password Protection  
- "The system allows setting a password for extra security when sharing files."  

## 🎥 Demo  
### Live Demo  
- Show how to **upload** a file.  
- Show how to **download** a file.  
- Demonstrate the **password protection** feature.  

## ⚡ Challenges and Solutions  
### 🚧 Challenges  
- "I faced challenges with **file size limits** and ensuring **secure password storage**."  
- "I used **bcrypt** to hash passwords and added **file size restrictions**."  

### 📚 Learning Outcomes  
- "I learned a lot about **file handling and security**."  

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
### Enhancements  
- "In the future, I would like to **add user accounts** and **improve the design** of the interface."
